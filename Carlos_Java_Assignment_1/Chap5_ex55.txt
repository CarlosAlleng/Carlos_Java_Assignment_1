 Question:

    Describe the four basic elements of counter-controlled iteration.             
                        
                        
 Answer:


    Initialization: 
    
    This is where you initialize a counter variable, typically to 0 or 1, depending 
    
    on how you want to start counting. This variable keeps track of the number of times the loop has iterated.

   
    Test condition: 
    
    This is an expression that determines whether the loop should continue iterating. 
    
    It is usually based on the counter variable and some other condition you want to check. 
    
    For example, the test condition might be counter <= 10, which means the loop will continue 
    
    as long as the counter is less than or equal to 10.

    
    Update statement: 
    
    This statement updates the counter variable after each iteration. It is usually used to increment 
    
    or decrement the counter by a certain value. For example, the update statement might be counter++,
    
    which means the counter will be incremented by 1 after each iteration.

    Loop body: 
    
    This is the block of code that is executed repeatedly while the test condition is true. It can contain
    
     any valid Java statements and can be as simple or as complex as you need.
