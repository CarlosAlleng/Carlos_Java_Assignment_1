Question

What is the difference between preincrementing and postincrementing a variable?

Answer

Both preincrement and postincrement are used to increment the value of a variable 
by 1 in Java. However, there is a subtle difference in how they are performed.

Preincrementing:

    The ++ operator is placed before the variable name and the value of the variable is 
    incremented by 1 before it is used in the expression.

Postincrementing:

    The ++ operator is placed after the variable name and the original value of the variable
     is used in the expression, and then it is incremented by 1.
