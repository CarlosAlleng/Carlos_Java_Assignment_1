Question
 
 (Instance Variables) Explain the purpose of an instance variable.

Answer

Instance variables are used to store data that is specific to each object of a class,
this data can be used by the methods of the class to perform their tasks.

For example, consider a class Car with instance variables such as make, 
model, year, and color. Each Car object created from this class will have
its own values for these variables, representing the make, model, year, and 
color of that specific car.
